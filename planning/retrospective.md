# Retrospective

## WEEK 1

## Stop Doing

1. **Start late**: We had a late start on Wednesday.
2. **Do not notify absences**: You need to notify others group members when you can not participate in a meeting.
3. **Big PR**: PR with many changes in a lot of files. Large PRs are hard to review.

## Continue Doing

1. **Organizing our tasks on the project board**: It helps tracking everything that needs to get done.
2. **Descriptive issues and PR**: It provides more detail and others can see what is being worked on.
3. **Commenting on a PR and review**: It is a good way to provide feedback and to discuss some topics about our project.

## Start Doing

1. **Start on time**: Have a meeting on Sunday after class to set up week's plan and share our tasks.
2. **Branch naming conventions**: Our feature branch should be descriptive (try to use the same name of an existing issue), prefixed with our initials or name.
3. **Small PR**: PR should have a singular focus. We need to decompose a larger task into smaller tasks to keep the PR focused.

## Lessons Learned

1. Git workflow
2. Collaborating on GitHub
3. Breaking up our development plan into smaller working pieces.
4. Develop a backlog.

5. Create wireframes.
