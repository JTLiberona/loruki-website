# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary
1. Tight schedules of our group members that often don't meet each other â€“ it's hard to find a time slot for a meeting, suitable for everyone!
2. One of our students has problems with her computer and cannot fully participate in the project
<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
